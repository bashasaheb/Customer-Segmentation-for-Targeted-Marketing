Project 1: Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing

Objective:

To perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior and demographics to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

Overview:

This project will utilize a dataset containing customer transaction data and demographic information. You will apply data analytics and machine learning techniques to segment customers into meaningful groups, enabling personalized marketing efforts.

Data Preparation:

Source Dataset: Updated Ultra Projects- Data Science

Tools & Techniques: SQL or MySQL for data querying and preprocessing, GIT for version control.

Steps:

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Objective: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and clean any inconsistencies or missing values.

Tools & Techniques: Python (Pandas and Numpy) for data manipulation, Microsoft Excel for initial data exploration.

Key Concepts: Handling missing values, outlier detection.

2. Feature Engineering:

Objective: Create new features that could be significant for customer segmentation, such as total spend, average transaction value, and purchase frequency.

Tools & Techniques: Python (Pandas) for creating new columns and aggregating data.

Key Concepts: Aggregation, feature creation.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Objective: Perform EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and insights in the customer data.

Tools & Techniques: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for visualization, Microsoft Excel for pivot tables.

Key Concepts: Distribution analysis, correlation analysis.

4. Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning:

Objective: Use a clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups based on their features.

Tools & Techniques: Python (Scikit-learn) for K-Means clustering, Pandas for data manipulation.
